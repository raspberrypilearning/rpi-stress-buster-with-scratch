## What next?

Now that you have made a button and know how to use it to control, have a think about what other games you could add a physical controller to. You could make your own game or remix somebody elses game.

You could also move on to the [third project in this pathway, and create a wire loop game](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpi-wire-loop-game-scratch), looking at how you can combine what you have learned about inputs and outputs into a brand new project.
