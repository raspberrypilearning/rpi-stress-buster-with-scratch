Car Smash Stress Ball:

This project has done several of those things! The sprite has been changed to a car, which has costumes showing increasing signs of damage to the car. 

The sounds are all added from the Scratch `Effects` library, and include: `Bonk`, `Crunch`, `Car Horn` and `Glass Breaking`.

The button has been upgraded by adding some contacts to either side of the insides of a martial arts kick pad. This allows the user to relieve the maximum stress possible by allowing them to hit the pad **very** hard!
